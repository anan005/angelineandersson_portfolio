        <span>Research of charity and sub-themes</span>

            <p>
                This helpline has existed since 1984, and there 
                is around 160 volunteers in Norway today. As well 
                a part of the large Global network Child Helpline 
                International.

            <img src="assets/serdumeg/5_research-kph.png" alt="Screenshot webpage of about-korspaahalsen" width="400px">

            <p>
                <strong>Selected sub-themes we wanted to highlight in the campaign:</strong>
            </p>

            <div class="list">

                <ul>

                    <li>- Child abuse</li>
                    <li>- Bullying</li>
                    <li>- Suicide</li>
    
                </ul>

            </div>

            <p>
                The reason we choosing these themes is to highlight the most
                common issues and questions from the children. These are serious 
                topics that are important to present how serious and relevant 
                those are in the lives of children and youth, in a respectable 
                way. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Child neglect and child abuse is often divided into 4 categories:</strong>
            </p>


            <div class="list">

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        - Mental abuse
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        - Physical abuse
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        - Absence of actions, in the form of physical<br>
                        and emotional neglect and neglect.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        - Other types of violence against children (bullying,<br>
                        witnesses of violence or violence in close relationships.)
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <p>
                Child abuse and neglect are performed by definition of the
                caregiver(s), as the person(s) who is responsible for the care. 
                Caregivers can be parents, foster parents, staff at child welfare 
                institutions, but also coaches or others who have temporary care for 
                the child. The definition of children in this context ranges from 0-18 years.
            </p>

            </a>

        <span>Target group</span>

            <p>The target group consists of a broad group of people ranging from 22 to 65+ years.
                What they have in common is that they are all concerned with the everyday lives of 
                children and young people, that they thrive in their surroundings and those around 
                them. They are empathetic towards the upbringing of children and young people, and 
                want to make a difference for those who fall outside a safe environment and framework. 
                This is a group of people who, on the basis of this, are engaged in charitable and 
                voluntary work for organizations that work with specific goals and issues.
            </p>

        <span>Concept and text content</span>

            <p>
                Focusing on the sub-themes, we created three fictive 
                stories about the children. Giving us the uppertunity
                to help them reach out to the world by telling a story
                of what they are going through daily.
            </p>

            <p>
                To also get a more clear picture of cases,
                based on statistics we also show the number of how
                children are involved.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adding a footer with key information about the campaign:<br>
                Who are we? We are three students from Interaction Design at Kristiania 
                University College. We have been tasked with creating a campaign website 
                for a chosen purpose. We chose to create a campaign for Kors på halsen, 
                an anonymous helpline service for children and youth up to the age of 18.
